# Analysis of Ireland Workforce

## 1\. Introduction

This project has the objective to analyse the workforce data in Ireland, to get a better understanding of the country that I just moved in and to practice my skills in Python and SQL.
For this process I design some questions for me to answer, this is for giving me a north star to what look for.

## QUESTIONS:

### Structural and Sectoral Evolution

1. Which economic sectors have experienced the highest growth since 2010, and how did the COVID-19 pandemic shift their trajectories?
2. How has foreign workforce participation evolved in Ireland since the early 2000s?
3. How has the balance between Full-time and Part-time employment shifted over time?
4. How have remote and hybrid work models expanded across Ireland over the past five years?
5. How has job tenure changed across sectors in Ireland over time?

### Demographic and Social Dynamics

6. Which gender consistently faces higher unemployment in Ireland, and has this gap narrowed over time?
7. How does marital status affect labour force participation in Ireland? ## How does marital status influence unemployment trends in Ireland?
8. How does age correlate with employment status across different stages of life?
9. What are the dominant employment sectors for students, and how do they differ from the general population? ## Do students experience higher unemployment rates compared to non-students?
10. In which sectors are students most employed today, and how does this differ from pre-pandemic patterns?

### Regional Disparities and Labour Geography

11. Which Irish regions have experienced the fastest Labour Force growth over the past decade?
12. Which regions have consistently reported the highest unemployment rates, and how have these rankings changed over time?

### Work Hours, Roles and Intensity

13. Which economic sectors report the longest average working hours in Ireland?
14. What are the actual average working hours for full-time and part-time employees, and how do they differ?
15. Which occupational groups work the longest hours on average, and has this changed post-pandemic?

## 2\. Data

The data that will be used is from CSO (Central Statistics Office), one of the biggest statistic hub from Ireland, that data will be gathered in JSON-stat format and transformed into .csv files that will be then read with the **pandas** library.
